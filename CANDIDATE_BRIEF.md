# Candidate Brief (Dart Backend)

**Submission window:** up to 4 days. **Expected effort:** 2–6 hours.  
Deliver a minimal, well-tested backend using the provided starter. The scope is intentionally small; quality over quantity.

### Deliverables
- Working code under `app/`
- `REPORT.md` (1–2 pages)
- ZIP or public repo link
- Optional: hosted demo URL and `/health`

### Notes
- You **do not** need prior Dart experience; the starter uses a simple HTTP framework.
- Keep it simple; document tradeoffs.
- If you run out of time, include TODOs in `REPORT.md`.
